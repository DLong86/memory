# Let's Talk

A new project I'm in the process of building, for an English language school, that will be a fun game to aid
teachers and students with questions on general topics to answer and discuss.

## Technologies

This project was built using React.JS, Tailwind.CSS, for the frontend, and Node.js and Express, for the backend.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## If you want to preview this project yourself:

- Pull this repository onto your local computer

- In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
